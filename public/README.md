ASSIGNMENT 2 - STATIC "TRAVEL EXPERT" AGENCY WEBSITE (WEBSITE ENHANCEMENT)

The aim of this project is to enhance the travel expert website already done in assignment with array for each loop (for gallery images) and make register/login forms updated based on html5. The hamburger menu should also be used for the navigation bars and made to toggle.

This was done with HTML, css and javascript. 

Pictures were taken from: Lorem picsum website and google image gallery.
Other refernces used in learning/debugging and clarifying:

1. USA Travel Experts website
2. Google Search
3. Stack overflow
4. MDN
5. Easy tutorials
6. codepen sample codes
7. Other websites not noted

There are 3 Html files, a folder containing css files and a folder of images used.
A consistent font style was defined for the website.
Navigations have hover and click styles declared.

Specifically i tried to debug the issue on my hamburger menu for the homepage, but could not based on time. It toggled, but wasnt pushing down other contents while displaying the nav bars.
